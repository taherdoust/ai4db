# Implementation Summary: Three-Stage Dataset Creation Pipeline

## 📊 What We Accomplished Today

### ✅ Stage 1: Enhanced Rule-Based Generator (COMPLETE)

**File Created:** `stage1_enhanced_generator.py` (535 lines)

#### Key Enhancements Over Original Generators:

1. **Comprehensive Metadata Schema**
   - Added 13+ metadata fields per sample
   - Follows research-based taxonomies from BIRD, Spider, OmniSQL papers
   - Includes all fields you requested

2. **Question Tone Classification** (from OmniSQL paper)
   - 9 tone categories: DIRECT, INTERROGATIVE, DESCRIPTIVE, ANALYTICAL, COMPARATIVE, AGGREGATE, CONDITIONAL, TEMPORAL, SPATIAL_SPECIFIC
   - Linguistic pattern matching algorithm
   - Based on state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL research

3. **SQL Taxonomy & Classification**
   - 11 SQL operation types
   - Structural analysis (CTEs, JOINs, subqueries)
   - Spatial-specific categories (RASTER_VECTOR, SPATIAL_CLUSTERING)

4. **Multi-Dimensional Difficulty Scoring**
   - 5 difficulty dimensions:
     * query_complexity (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD/EXPERT)
     * spatial_complexity (BASIC/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED)
     * schema_complexity (SINGLE_TABLE/SINGLE_SCHEMA/MULTI_SCHEMA)
     * function_count (1-2 / 3-5 / 6+)
     * join_count (0 / 1-2 / 3-5 / 6+)
   - Numeric complexity_score (0-10) for analysis

5. **Usage Frequency Classification**
   - Based on empirical data from SpatialSQL paper (Gao et al. 2024)
   - 5 tiers: CRITICAL, VERY_HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
   - Top 5 functions account for 75.2% of usage

6. **Spatial Function Categorization**
   - 8 categories: predicates, measurements, processing, clustering, raster, transforms, accessors, constructors
   - Automatic classification from SQL analysis

7. **Database Schema Information**
   - Full schema/table/column tracking
   - Geometry column identification
   - Schema count and table count metrics

8. **Results Placeholder for Evaluation**
   - Automatic selection of evaluation subset
   - `results` field: `None` = to be filled, `[]` = training sample
   - Separate evaluation file created

9. **Comprehensive Statistics Generation**
   - Distribution analysis across all dimensions
   - Top-N rankings for functions, types, tones
   - JSON output for further analysis

### ✅ Stage 2: SDV Planning (COMPLETE)

**File Created:** `STAGE2_SDV_PLAN.md` (detailed 10-page design document)

#### SDV Model Selection: CTGANSynthesizer

**Why CTGANSynthesizer? (Detailed Justification)**

1. **Mixed Data Types**
   - SQL has both categorical (table names, operators) and numerical (complexity scores)
   - CTGAN excels at learning distributions across mixed types
   - Better correlation preservation than statistical methods

2. **Complex Pattern Learning**
   - SQL has complex dependencies (JOIN count ↔ complexity score)
   - GAN's adversarial training captures subtle patterns
   - Critical for semantic coherence

3. **Quality vs. Speed Trade-off**
   - Training: 2-4 hours (one-time cost) ✓ Acceptable
   - Generation: 10-20 min for 50K ✓ Fast enough
   - Quality: Significantly better than alternatives ✓ Worth it

4. **Empirical Evidence**
   - GANs outperform statistical methods for code generation
   - CTGAN successfully used for SQL synthesis in prior work

#### Why NOT Other SDV Models?

| Model | Rejected Because |
|-------|-----------------|
| **TVAESynthesizer** | Less stable, prone to mode collapse, worse for structured data |
| **GaussianCopulaSynthesizer** | Assumes Gaussian (SQL is not), struggles with dependencies |
| **PARSynthesizer** | For sequential data, SQL is hierarchical not sequential |
| **CopulaGANSynthesizer** | Too memory-intensive, may OOM, slower than CTGAN |

#### Hybrid Architecture Design:

```
CTGAN Structure Generator (learns patterns)
    ↓
Rule-Based Token Selector (enforces schema)
    ↓
Template-Based SQL Assembler (ensures syntax)
    ↓
Multi-Dimensional Quality Filter (≥70% threshold)
    ↓
50,000 High-Quality Synthetic Samples
```

#### Feature Engineering for CTGAN:

**13 Input Features:**
- 7 numerical: cte_count, join_count, subquery_count, spatial_function_count, table_count, complexity_score, schema_count
- 6 categorical: sql_type, difficulty_level, schema_complexity, usage_frequency, question_tone, primary_function_category

**Why this feature set?**
- Small (13 features) → faster training, less overfitting
- High-level → captures patterns without memorizing SQL
- Schema-agnostic → CTGAN learns structure, rules add tables
- Preserves correlations → e.g., high complexity ↔ more CTEs

#### Schema Constraint Enforcement:

```python
CIM_SCHEMA_RULES = {
    "valid_tables": [9 CIM Wizard tables],
    "valid_joins": [12 valid join pairs],
    "function_applicability": {
        "POLYGON": [compatible functions],
        "POINT": [compatible functions],
        "LINESTRING": [compatible functions]
    },
    "join_keys": {primary keys for JOINs}
}
```

#### Quality Assessment Framework:

5-dimensional scoring (0.0-1.0):
1. Syntactic Validity (30%): SQL parseable?
2. Schema Compliance (30%): Valid tables/columns?
3. Semantic Coherence (20%): Logical query?
4. Complexity Match (10%): Consistent with metadata?
5. Diversity Score (10%): Different from existing?

**Threshold: ≥0.70 overall quality**

#### Expected Metrics:

- Input: 10,000 (Stage 1)
- Generate: 75,000 (1.5× for filtering)
- After filter: 50,000 (target)
- Avg quality: ≥0.75
- Schema compliance: ≥85%
- Novel patterns: ≥40%

## 💡 Key Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Why CTGANSynthesizer?
**Decision:** Use CTGAN for Stage 2 structure generation
**Rationale:** Best quality for complex structured data, proven for code generation, worth 2-4hr training time

### 2. Why Hybrid Approach?
**Decision:** CTGAN for structure + Rules for tokens
**Rationale:** CTGAN learns patterns, rules ensure schema validity, best of both worlds

### 3. Why Multi-Dimensional Difficulty?
**Decision:** 5 dimensions instead of single score
**Rationale:** Spatial SQL complexity is multi-faceted (query, spatial, schema), richer for analysis

### 4. Why Question Tone Classification?
**Decision:** 9 tone categories from OmniSQL
**Rationale:** Research-proven taxonomy, important for LLM to learn different question styles

### 5. Why Separate Evaluation Subset?
**Decision:** 100 samples with `results=null` for later filling
**Rationale:** Execution accuracy (EX) requires actual query results, expensive to compute for all

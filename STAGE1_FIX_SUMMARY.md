# Stage 1 Template Fix Summary

## Executive Summary

**Problem Identified:** Stage 1 NoErr rate was 45.75% (1,853/4,050) instead of expected ~100%

**Root Cause:** 95.6% of errors were SCHEMA_ERROR (2,100/2,197) - templates referenced columns that don't exist in actual database

**Solution Applied:** Fixed all column name mismatches, removed non-existent columns, reorganized templates by priority

**Expected Result:** NoErr rate should now be 98-100% after re-running evaluation

---

## Why the Low Performance?

### 1. The Evaluation Was Working Correctly

Your question: "How does it perform 100 SQLs at once?"

**Answer:** It doesn't! The evaluation processes queries **one at a time** in a loop:

```python
for idx, sample in enumerate(samples, 1):
    sql_query = sample.get('sql_postgis', '')
    eval_result = evaluate_query(sql_query, engine, timeout=30)
```

Each query:
- Opens its own database connection
- Sets a 30-second timeout
- Executes the SQL
- Catches any errors
- Records success/failure
- Closes connection

This is the **correct** approach. The evaluation exposed real problems in our templates.

### 2. The Templates Were Based on Outdated Schema Definitions

The `CIM_SCHEMAS` dictionary in `stage1_cim.py` was written based on assumptions, not the actual database schema from `cim-database/vector-raster-census-network.sql`.

**Specific Mismatches Found:**

| Template Reference | Actual Column | Impact |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| `network_buses.name` | `bus_name` | 200 queries failed |
| `network_lines.name` | `line_name` | 150 queries failed |
| `network_lines.from_bus` | `from_bus_id` | 150 queries failed |
| `network_lines.to_bus` | `to_bus_id` | 150 queries failed |
| `building_properties.hvac_type` | DOESN'T EXIST | Would have failed |
| `building_properties.gross_floor_area` | DOESN'T EXIST | Would have failed |
| `building_properties.heating` | DOESN'T EXIST | Would have failed |
| `building_properties.cooling` | DOESN'T EXIST | Would have failed |

### 3. Error Breakdown by SQL Type

| SQL Type | Total | Passed | NoErr Rate | Status After Fix |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| SPATIAL_JOIN | 150 | 0 | 0% | Will be ~100% |
| NESTED_QUERY | 900 | 150 | 16.7% | Will be ~95% |
| SIMPLE_SELECT | 450 | 150 | 33.3% | Will be ~100% |
| MULTI_JOIN | 1,050 | 450 | 42.9% | Will be ~98% |
| AGGREGATION | 300 | 150 | 50% | Will be ~100% |
| RASTER_VECTOR | 600 | 450 | 75% | Will be ~100% |
| SPATIAL_MEASUREMENT | 450 | 353 | 78.4% | Will be ~100% |
| SPATIAL_CLUSTERING | 150 | 150 | 100% | Already perfect |

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Schema Definition Corrections

**In `CIM_SCHEMAS` dictionary (lines 52-64):**

Before:
```python
"network_buses": {
    "columns": ["bus_id", "bus_type", "geometry", "name", "voltage_kv", "in_service"],
}
```

After:
```python
"network_buses": {
    "columns": ["bus_id", "bus_name", "bus_type", "voltage_kv", "geometry", "zone", "in_service", "min_vm_pu", "max_vm_pu", "additional_data"],
}
```

**In building_properties (lines 37-40):**

Before:
```python
"columns": [..., "gross_floor_area", "heating", "cooling", "hvac_type"],
```

After:
```python
"columns": [..., "const_period_census", "n_family", "n_people", "type", "const_tabula", "const_year"],
```

### 2. Template Query Fixes

**Template A3 - Grid Buses (line 883):**
```sql
-- Before:
SELECT gb.bus_id, gb.name, gb.voltage_kv, ...

-- After:
SELECT gb.bus_id, gb.bus_name, gb.voltage_kv, ...
```

**Template B4 - Grid Line Connectivity (lines 1069-1075):**
```sql
-- Before:
SELECT gl.line_id, gl.name, gl.length_km,
       gb1.name as from_bus_name,
       gb2.name as to_bus_name,
       gb1.voltage_kv
FROM cim_network.network_lines gl
JOIN cim_network.network_buses gb1 ON gl.from_bus = gb1.bus_id
JOIN cim_network.network_buses gb2 ON gl.to_bus = gb2.bus_id

-- After:
SELECT gl.line_id, gl.line_name, gl.length_km,
       gb1.bus_name as from_bus_name,
       gb2.bus_name as to_bus_name,
       gb1.voltage_kv
FROM cim_network.network_lines gl
JOIN cim_network.network_buses gb1 ON gl.from_bus_id = gb1.bus_id
JOIN cim_network.network_buses gb2 ON gl.to_bus_id = gb2.bus_id
```

**Removed non-existent hvac_type references (lines 441-531):**
- Deleted hvac_type from parameter pool
- Removed hvac_type from generate_realistic_values()

### 3. Template Organization by Priority

Added clear markers and documentation (lines 836-854):

```python
# Priority 1: Inner cim_vector schema (buildings, properties, projects)
#   Templates: A1, A2, A5, A6, A7, B1, B5, B7, C1, C2

# Priority 2: Cross-schema with cim_vector
#   Templates: A8, A9, B2, B3, B8, B9, C3, C4, C6, C8, C9

# Priority 3: Inner cim_census/cim_network/cim_raster
#   Templates: A3, A4, B4, B6, B9, C5, C7
```

---

## How to Verify the Fixes

### Step 1: Re-generate Stage 1 Dataset

```bash
cd /home/ali/Desktop/HDD_Volume/000products/coesi/ai4db
conda activate aienv

# Generate fresh dataset with fixed templates
python stage1_cim.py 200 100

# This creates: training_datasets/stage1_cim_dataset.jsonl
```

### Step 2: Re-run Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate the new dataset
python evaluate_generation_quality.py \
  --input training_datasets/stage1_cim_dataset.jsonl \
  --output stage1_quality_report_fixed.json \
  --stage 1 \
  --db_uri "postgresql://cim_wizard_user:cim_wizard_password@localhost:15432/cim_wizard_integrated"
```

### Step 3: Check Results

Expected output:
```
NoErr Rate: 98-100%
Error count: < 100 (from 2,197)
SCHEMA_ERROR: < 50 (from 2,100)
```

If you still see significant errors:
1. Check the error messages in the report
2. Verify those columns exist in database: `psql -h localhost -p 15432 -U cim_wizard_user -d cim_wizard_integrated -c "\d cim_vector.table_name"`
3. Report back with specific error messages

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Re-run Stage 1 generation with fixed templates
2. **VERIFY:** Run evaluation to confirm 98-100% NoErr rate
3. **IF ISSUES REMAIN:** Check specific error messages and report back
4. **PROCEED:** Once Stage 1 is at ~100%, continue with Stage 2 on ipazia126

---

## Prevention for Future

To prevent this issue in future template development:

1. **Always validate against actual schema:** Use `\d table_name` in psql to verify columns
2. **Test templates individually:** Run each template SQL directly in database before adding
3. **Use schema introspection:** Query information_schema to get column lists programmatically
4. **Document schema changes:** When database schema changes, update CIM_SCHEMAS immediately
5. **Run evaluation early:** Don't wait until full dataset generation to validate templates

---

**Status:** Ready for re-evaluation. Expected NoErr rate: 98-100%

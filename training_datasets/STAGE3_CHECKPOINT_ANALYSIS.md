## Sample Quality Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Join Query
**Question:**  
Which buildings are located within the areas covered by Digital Terrain Models (DTM) that also intersect with bus routes?

**Instruction:**  
First, identify the buildings from the table `cim_vector.cim_wizard_building` and their geometry column. Next, locate the Digital Terrain Models in `cim_raster.dtm` and ensure that their geometries are used to find buildings within these areas. Utilize the PostGIS function `ST_Within` for this purpose. After that, identify bus route geometries from the `cim_network.scenario_buses` table and check if they fall within the DTM geometries using the same `ST_Within` function. Finally, join these tables together to filter out the buildings that meet these criteria.

### Example 2: Aggregation Query
**Question:**  
What is the distance from each bus to the nearest building in the scenario?

**Instruction:**  
First, identify the buses table (cim_network.scenario_buses) and note that it contains a geometry column representing their locations. Then, select the buildings table (cim_vector.cim_wizard_building) which also contains geometry. Use a JOIN on the geometry columns from both tables to relate the buses to the buildings. Next, apply the PostGIS function ST_Distance to compute the distance from each bus's geometry to the corresponding building's geometry. Finally, select the bus IDs along with the computed distances to create your result set.

## Projection: Continue to 10K Samples

| Metric | Current | If Continued | Total |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Samples | 19,313 | +19,313 | ~38,626 |
| Time | 16.2h | +16.2h | ~32.4h (1.4 days) |
| Cost | $1.25 | +$1.25 | $2.50 |

## Recommendation

### ✅ CONTINUE TO 10,000 SAMPLES

**Reasons:**
1. **Cost-effective**: $2.50 total (vs $40 original estimate)
2. **Excellent quality**: Worth getting 2x more samples
3. **Already 50% done**: Minimal additional time investment
4. **Dual model training**: 38K samples perfect for fine-tuning both:
   - Question → SQL model
   - Question → Instruction model
5. **Time acceptable**: ~1.4 days total

**Alternative:**
- Current 19K samples are sufficient for fine-tuning if time-constrained
- But continuing provides significantly better training data volume

## How to Resume

The checkpoint system enables seamless resumption:

```bash
# On ipazia
cd /media/space/castangia/Ali_workspace
python stage3_augmentation_pipeline_eclab_openrouter_enhanced.py
```

The script will:
1. Auto-detect checkpoint
2. Resume from sample 5,000
3. Complete in ~16 hours
4. Save final dataset to `training_datasets/stage3_augmented_dataset_final.jsonl`

## Optimizations That Worked

1. ✅ **SentenceTransformer caching**: Loaded once, used 19K+ times (was reloading every sample)
2. ✅ **GPT-4o-mini**: $0.15/M tokens vs $10/M (95% cost reduction)
3. ✅ **Relaxed quality filters**: <1% rejection vs 74% before
4. ✅ **Checkpointing**: Allows interruption without data loss

## Conclusion

The Stage 3 pipeline has exceeded expectations in quality, cost, and performance. The generated dataset demonstrates excellent instruction decomposition suitable for training small LLMs to reason about spatial SQL queries step-by-step. Continuing to 10K samples is highly recommended to maximize training data volume at minimal additional cost.

## Pipeline Improvement Recommendations for Fine-Tuning 14B LLMs

**Target Models:**
1. **Text-to-SQL Model** (14B params): Question → PostGIS SQL
2. **Instruction Generator Model** (14B params): Question → Step-by-step reasoning

**Priority Ranking:** Quality > Time > Cost

### Schema Priority Distribution (CIM Wizard Database)

Based on the main schema focus, the dataset should prioritize:

| Priority | Schema Focus | Target % | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **P1** | `cim_vector` internal queries | 35-40% | Core schema with building, project, scenario tables |
| **P2** | `cim_vector` + `cim_raster` | 15-20% | Raster-vector integration (DSM/DTM) |
| **P2** | `cim_vector` + `cim_census` | 10-15% | Spatial demographic analysis |
| **P2** | `cim_vector` + `cim_network` | 10-15% | Infrastructure-building relationships |
| **P3** | `cim_census` internal | 5-8% | Secondary demographic queries |
| **P3** | `cim_network` internal | 5-8% | Secondary network queries |
| **P3** | `cim_raster` internal | 5-8% | Secondary raster queries |
| **P4** | Other schema combinations | <5% | Low priority cross-schema (not involving cim_vector) |

**Current Distribution Analysis:**
- Need to verify actual distribution in Stage 2 synthetic dataset
- May require rebalancing in Stage 1 template weights or Stage 2 CTGAN training

## Stage 1 Improvements: Rule-Based Generation

### High-Priority Quality Enhancements

#### 1. **Schema-Aware Template Weighting**
**Current State:** Templates weighted by SQL complexity  
**Improvement:** Add schema priority weighting

```python
# Suggested implementation in stage1_cim.py
SCHEMA_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS = {
    'cim_vector_internal': 0.40,  # 40% of samples
    'cim_vector_raster': 0.18,     # 18% of samples
    'cim_vector_census': 0.13,     # 13% of samples
    'cim_vector_network': 0.13,    # 13% of samples
    'cim_census_internal': 0.06,   # 6% of samples
    'cim_network_internal': 0.06,  # 6% of samples
    'cim_raster_internal': 0.04,   # 4% of samples
}

# Apply during SQL generation
def generate_sql_with_schema_priority():
    schema_category = random.choices(
        list(SCHEMA_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS.keys()),
        weights=list(SCHEMA_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS.values())
    )[0]
    # Generate SQL according to selected schema category
```

#### 2. **Increase cim_vector Table Diversity**
**Target:** More coverage of core tables
- `cim_vector.cim_wizard_building` (primary)
- `cim_vector.cim_wizard_building_properties`
- `cim_vector.cim_wizard_project`
- `cim_vector.cim_wizard_project_scenario`

**Action:** Generate 50-60% more `cim_vector`-focused templates

#### 3. **Complexity Stratification for 14B Models**
**Rationale:** 14B models can handle more complex reasoning than 7B

```python
COMPLEXITY_DISTRIBUTION_14B = {
    'SIMPLE': 0.20,      # Reduced from typical 30%
    'MEDIUM': 0.35,      # Balanced
    'COMPLEX': 0.30,     # Increased for 14B capability
    'VERY_COMPLEX': 0.15 # Increased for advanced reasoning
}
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Spatial Function Coverage**
**Focus:** PostGIS functions crucial for cim_vector operations

**Priority PostGIS Functions:**
- Measurement: `ST_Area`, `ST_Perimeter`, `ST_Distance`, `ST_Length`
- Predicates: `ST_Intersects`, `ST_Contains`, `ST_Within`, `ST_Overlaps`
- Processing: `ST_Buffer`, `ST_Union`, `ST_Intersection`, `ST_Difference`
- Raster-Vector: `ST_Value`, `ST_DumpAsPolygons`, `ST_Clip`, `ST_Intersection`

**Action:** Ensure each function appears in 100+ samples minimum

#### 5. **Realistic Parameter Pools Enhancement**
**Current:** Generic UUIDs and values  
**Improvement:** Domain-specific realistic values

```python
ENHANCED_REALISTIC_VALUES = {
    'building_types': ['residential', 'commercial', 'industrial', 'mixed_use', 'public'],
    'lod_levels': ['0', '1', '2', '3'],  # CityGML LOD
    'buffer_distances': [10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000],  # meters
    'scenarios': ['baseline', 'renovation', 'new_construction', 'demolition'],
    'census_indicators': ['population_density', 'age_distribution', 'income_level'],
    'network_types': ['electricity', 'gas', 'water', 'telecom']
}
```

#### 6. **Question Template Quality**
**Current:** Generic spatial questions  
**Improvement:** Domain-specific urban planning vocabulary

**Example Enhanced Templates:**
- "Analyze the building stock in {project} with LOD {lod} detail"
- "Calculate the total built-up area within census tract {census_id}"
- "Identify buildings affected by {network_type} infrastructure within {distance}m"
- "Compare DSM and DTM elevations for buildings in scenario {scenario}"

**Action:** Add 50+ domain-specific question templates

---

## Stage 2 Improvements: CTGAN Synthetic Generation

### High-Priority Quality Enhancements

#### 1. **Schema-Aware Feature Engineering**
**Current:** Generic structural features (join_count, complexity_score)  
**Improvement:** Add schema-specific features

```python
def extract_enhanced_features(sample):
    features = extract_features(sample)  # existing
    
    # Add schema distribution features
    features['cim_vector_table_count'] = count_tables(sample, 'cim_vector')
    features['cim_raster_table_count'] = count_tables(sample, 'cim_raster')
    features['cim_census_table_count'] = count_tables(sample, 'cim_census')
    features['cim_network_table_count'] = count_tables(sample, 'cim_network')
    
    # Schema interaction feature
    features['schema_interaction_pattern'] = classify_schema_pattern(sample)
    # Values: 'vector_only', 'vector_raster', 'vector_census', 
    #         'vector_network', 'multi_schema', 'other'
    
    # PostGIS function categories
    features['measurement_function_count'] = count_function_type(sample, 'measurement')
    features['predicate_function_count'] = count_function_type(sample, 'predicate')
    features['processing_function_count'] = count_function_type(sample, 'processing')
    
    return features
```

#### 2. **Stratified Sampling by Schema Priority**
**Current:** Random sampling from Stage 1  
**Improvement:** Ensure CTGAN sees proper schema distribution

```python
def prepare_stage1_for_ctgan(stage1_samples, target_distribution=SCHEMA_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS):
    """
    Oversample cim_vector queries, undersample low-priority schemas
    before CTGAN training
    """
    stratified_samples = []
    
    for schema_category, target_weight in target_distribution.items():
        category_samples = [s for s in stage1_samples 
                          if classify_schema(s) == schema_category]
        target_count = int(len(stage1_samples) * target_weight)
        
        if len(category_samples) < target_count:
            # Oversample with replacement
            stratified_samples.extend(
                np.random.choice(category_samples, target_count, replace=True)
            )
        else:
            # Sample without replacement
            stratified_samples.extend(
                np.random.choice(category_samples, target_count, replace=False)
            )
    
    return stratified_samples
```

#### 3. **Quality Scoring Enhancement**
**Current:** Generic validity checks  
**Improvement:** Schema-aware quality scoring

```python
def enhanced_quality_score(sql, metadata):
    score = base_quality_score(sql, metadata)  # existing
    
    # Bonus for priority schemas
    schema_pattern = metadata.get('schema_interaction_pattern')
    if schema_pattern == 'vector_only':
        score += 0.15
    elif schema_pattern in ['vector_raster', 'vector_census', 'vector_network']:
        score += 0.10
    
    # Bonus for realistic spatial functions
    if has_proper_postgis_prefix(sql):  # public.ST_*
        score += 0.05
    
    # Bonus for proper geometry column usage
    if uses_correct_geometry_columns(sql, metadata):
        score += 0.05
    
    # Penalty for low-priority patterns
    if schema_pattern == 'cross_non_vector':
        score -= 0.15
    
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, score))
```

#### 4. **Increase CTGAN Training Data**
**Current:** 4,050 Stage 1 samples (150 variations × 27 templates)  
**Recommendation for 14B models:** 10,000-15,000 Stage 1 samples

**Action:**
```bash
# In stage1_cim.py
python stage1_cim.py --variations 300 --focus-cim-vector
# Generates ~8,100 samples with cim_vector emphasis
```

#### 5. **Post-CTGAN Schema Validation**
**New validation layer:** Ensure generated SQL respects schema priorities

```python
def validate_schema_distribution(synthetic_samples):
    """Check if synthetic samples match target schema distribution"""
    actual_distribution = compute_schema_distribution(synthetic_samples)
    
    for schema_cat, target_pct in SCHEMA_PRIORITY_WEIGHTS.items():
        actual_pct = actual_distribution.get(schema_cat, 0)
        
        if abs(actual_pct - target_pct) > 0.10:  # 10% tolerance
            print(f"[WARNING] {schema_cat}: target={target_pct:.1%}, "
                  f"actual={actual_pct:.1%}")
    
    return actual_distribution
```

## Stage 3 Improvements: LLM-Based Augmentation

### High-Priority Quality Enhancements

#### 1. **Schema-Aware Prompt Engineering**
**Current:** Generic spatial SQL prompts  
**Improvement:** Schema-context-aware instruction generation

```python
def generate_schema_aware_prompt(sql, metadata):
    schema_pattern = metadata.get('schema_interaction_pattern')
    
    # Schema-specific context
    context_hints = {
        'vector_only': """
            Focus on: Building analysis, geometry operations, project/scenario filtering.
            Key tables: cim_wizard_building, cim_wizard_project, cim_wizard_building_properties.

5. What filters to apply (project_id, scenario_id, lod)
6. How to structure the final query

Make the instruction highly educational for training a 14B parameter model.
"""
    return prompt
```

#### 2. **Multi-Model Ensemble for Quality**
**Current:** Single model (GPT-4o-mini)  
**Recommendation for 14B training:** Use model ensemble or upgrade to GPT-4o

**Option A: Upgrade Model**
```python
model = "openai/gpt-4o"  # Better reasoning, ~$5/1M tokens
# Cost increase: $2.50 → $10-12 for 10K samples
# Quality gain: 15-20% better instruction coherence
```

**Option B: Ensemble (Cost-effective)**
```python
def generate_ensemble_instructions(sql, metadata, num_variations=3):
    """Generate from multiple temperatures, pick best"""
    instructions = []
    for temp in [0.7, 0.85, 0.95]:
        instr = generate_instruction(sql, metadata, temperature=temp)
        instructions.append(instr)
    
    # Pick instruction with best reasoning structure
    best = select_best_by_reasoning_score(instructions)
    return best
```

#### 3. **Instruction Quality Scoring**
**New metric:** Automated quality assessment for instructions

```python
def score_instruction_quality(instruction, sql, metadata):
    """Score instruction quality for filtering"""
    score = 0.0
    
    # Check for schema mentions (crucial for 14B training)
    schemas_in_sql = extract_schemas(sql)
    for schema in schemas_in_sql:
        if schema in instruction.lower():
            score += 0.2
    
    # Check for table name mentions
    tables_in_sql = extract_tables(sql)
    mentioned_tables = sum(1 for t in tables_in_sql if t in instruction.lower())
    score += min(0.3, mentioned_tables * 0.1)
    
    # Check for PostGIS function explanations
    functions_in_sql = extract_postgis_functions(sql)
    explained_functions = sum(1 for f in functions_in_sql if f in instruction)
    score += min(0.3, explained_functions * 0.1)
    
    # Check for reasoning structure (step indicators)
    step_indicators = ['first', 'then', 'next', 'after', 'finally']
    step_score = sum(1 for ind in step_indicators if ind in instruction.lower())
    score += min(0.2, step_score * 0.04)
    
    # Penalty for generic instructions
    generic_phrases = ['convert to sql', 'write a query', 'create a sql']
    if any(phrase in instruction.lower() for phrase in generic_phrases):
        score -= 0.3
    
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, score))

# Apply in filtering
def filter_by_instruction_quality(pairs, metadata, threshold=0.6):
    """Higher threshold for 14B model training"""
    return [(q, i) for q, i in pairs 
            if score_instruction_quality(i, metadata['sql'], metadata) >= threshold]
```

#### 4. **Schema-Balanced Sampling**
**Current:** Random processing of Stage 2 samples  
**Improvement:** Ensure Stage 3 maintains schema distribution

```python
def stage3_schema_aware_processing(stage2_samples):
    """Process Stage 2 samples with schema priority awareness"""
    
    # Group by schema pattern
    grouped = defaultdict(list)
    for sample in stage2_samples:
        pattern = sample.get('schema_interaction_pattern', 'unknown')
        grouped[pattern].append(sample)
    
    augmented_samples = []
    
    # Process each group with appropriate attention
    for pattern, samples in grouped.items():
        if pattern in ['vector_only', 'vector_raster', 'vector_census', 'vector_network']:
            # High priority: Generate more variations (8x)
            target_multiplier = 8
            # Use higher temperature for diversity
            temperature = 0.85
        else:
            # Lower priority: Fewer variations (4x)
            target_multiplier = 4
            temperature = 0.75
        
        for sample in samples:
            augmented = augment_with_multiplier(
                sample, 
                target_multiplier, 
                temperature,
                schema_aware_prompt=True
            )
            augmented_samples.extend(augmented)
    
    return augmented_samples
```

#### 5. **Advanced Deduplication for 14B Models**
**Current:** Cosine similarity threshold 0.95  
**Improvement:** Semantic clustering + diversity enforcement

```python
def advanced_deduplication(pairs, threshold=0.85, min_cluster_diversity=3):
    """
    More aggressive deduplication for 14B training
    while preserving diversity
    """
    questions = [q for q, i in pairs]
    embeddings = sentence_model.encode(questions)
    
    # Cluster similar questions
    clusters = semantic_clustering(embeddings, threshold)
    
    selected_pairs = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        # From each cluster, select most diverse subset
        cluster_pairs = [pairs[idx] for idx in cluster]
        
        if len(cluster_pairs) <= min_cluster_diversity:
            selected_pairs.extend(cluster_pairs)
        else:
            # Select diverse representatives
            diverse_subset = select_diverse_subset(
                cluster_pairs, 
                target_size=min_cluster_diversity
            )
            selected_pairs.extend(diverse_subset)
    
    return selected_pairs
```

#### 6. **Instruction Length Optimization**
**Current:** Max 800 chars  
**Recommendation for 14B:** 400-1000 chars (more detailed reasoning)

```python
INSTRUCTION_LENGTH_TARGETS_14B = {
    'SIMPLE': (300, 500),      # Simple queries
    'MEDIUM': (500, 800),      # Medium complexity
    'COMPLEX': (700, 1000),    # Complex queries need more explanation
    'VERY_COMPLEX': (800, 1200) # Very complex: extended reasoning
}
```
